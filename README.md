This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, setup the excutable environment for project.

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

After that, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start configuring server setting by modifying `src/server.js`. The server auto-updates as you changed setting.
